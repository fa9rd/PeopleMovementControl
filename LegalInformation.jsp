	In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites ("links") that are outside the area of ??responsibility of the author, a liability obligation would only come into force in accordance with Section 5 (2) TDG if the author was aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the event of illegal content. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The author therefore expressly declares that at the time the links were created, the corresponding linked pages were free of illegal content. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The author has no influence on the current and future design and on the content of the linked pages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He therefore hereby expressly distances himself from all content on all linked / connected pages that were changed after the link was created. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This statement applies to all links and references within our own website as well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by the author. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damage resulting from the use or non-use of information provided in this way, the provider of the page to which reference is made is solely liable, not the one who merely refers to the respective publication via links.
